# OMNIX AI — Project Overview
Smart management system: FE=React(Vite,JS), Mobile First, Atomic Design, Styled Components, Framer Motion, Zustand, ES6+, Hooks, ARIA.  
BE=Nest.js+Python(AI), AWS Lambda, DynamoDB, Serverless.  
API First — spec=omnix-api.yaml.  
Design System=atoms→molecules→organisms→pages→templates.  
Principles: Clean & performant code, reusable/testable components, accessibility, state in Zustand, animations via Framer Motion.  
**Workflow: Work must be based on tasks in `task_status.md`. Upon task completion, its status must be updated. At the beginning of each session, check the last worked-on task and its completion status.** Sources of truth: omnix-api.yaml, task_status.md, CLAUDE.md.  
Goal: Implement FE tasks based on API & status files, matching spec exactly.

# OMNIX AI — Story Overview

OMNIX AI was born from daily pain in supermarkets: unsold stock, empty shelves, and manual processes wasting precious time. Its goal is a smart system that learns from past sales, predicts demand, and provides managers with clear, actionable insights.

The system acts like a "super-smart manager": showing real-time alerts, intuitive dashboards, and AI-powered order recommendations. It forecasts demand by season, promotions, and trends, turning inventory and ordering into data-driven decisions instead of guesswork.

OMNIX AI is more than a management tool — it’s a strategic partner, automating tedious tasks, enabling growth, and giving managers back time and profitability through predictive intelligence and a clear, interactive interface.
